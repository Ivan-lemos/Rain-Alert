GOAL:
Building a Rain Alert Application
We will write Python code that sends a text message in the morning, just before we head out, to remind us to bring an umbrella if rain is expected during the day.

This way, we do not have to check the weather manually. Our reliable application will always alert us via SMS if we need to bring an umbrella before leaving home.

In the next lesson, we will begin building our application and delve deeper into API authentication.

Key Takeaways:
Learned about API keys and authentication methods for accessing APIs securely.
Understood the use of environment variables for safely storing sensitive information like API keys.
Explored how to send SMS messages using Python and the Twilio API.
Built a rain alert application that sends SMS notifications to remind users to bring an umbrella if rain is forecasted.

Challenges:
Uploaded and ran Python scripts on PythonAnywhere to automate scheduled tasks.
Resolved Twilio ConnectionError on free PythonAnywhere accounts by configuring a proxy client.
Set up scheduled tasks on PythonAnywhere to run scripts automatically at specified times.
Adjusted scheduled task times considering UTC and local time zones for accurate execution.
